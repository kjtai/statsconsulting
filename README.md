# Understanding the Post-Pandemic Surge in Credit Card Delinquencies

This is the GitHub repository for our final project in STSCI 4850. This repository contains the code and analysis related to our investigation into rising credit card delinquency rates in the United States during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Project Overview

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, credit card delinquencies have risen significantly, raising alarms about the financial vulnerability of U.S. householdsâ€”particularly among **low- to middle-income communities**. This project was commissioned by **CivicCore Institute**, a nonprofit committed to community economic resilience, to understand the *drivers* behind this trend and support data-driven interventions.

Our work explores how **macroeconomic conditions** (like unemployment, inflation, and interest rates), **demographic factors** (such as age and income), and **regional disparities** contribute to credit stress. The findings aim to inform local policymakers, nonprofit service providers, and financial educators.

## Project Goals

- Identify the factors most strongly associated with rising credit card delinquencies
- Explore how age, income level, and geographic location influence delinquency rates
- Analyze the delayed effects (lags) of macroeconomic indicators on delinquency behavior
- Provide actionable recommendations for proactive, community-based financial strategies

---

## Key Questions

- What are the national and demographic trends in credit card delinquencies post-2021?
- Which macroeconomic variables best predict future delinquency rates?
- How do delinquency patterns differ across income brackets, age groups, and regions?
- Do changes in inflation, unemployment, and interest rates have delayed impacts?
